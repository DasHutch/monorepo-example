# Javascript Monorepo

All of Omaze's javascript apps, and components (react)

We're using `lerna` & `yarn workspaces` to assist managing this monorepo.

(_note: only use `yarn`, do *not* use `npm`. they don't play well together._)

## Development

You'll need the following installed:

- node / npm -- `brew install node` (assuming MacOS & brew installed already)
- yarn -- `npm install -g yarn`

that's it.

### Directory Layout
`root / packages`

this is where all reusable components / packages / services will live

`root / apps`

this is where all standalone apps will live
